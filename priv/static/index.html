  <h3><blink style='text-decoration:underline'>Very</blink> simple instructions</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Go to &lt;/room/[random room name]&gt; (e.g. <a src="https://droptracker.herokuapp.com/room/sitnoob">https://droptracker.herokuapp.com/room/sitnoob</a>), and tell your friends to go there as well (doesn't matter if they join later, it syncs
      up)
    </li>

    <li>Push the down arrow until you get the item you want</li>

  </ul>

  <h3>Description</h3>

  <p>
    This is a website for tracking drops you get while out with the lads/lasses/mates. It is realtime-shared with your friends,
    so everyone can collaborate on the same "drop sheet". It also has fuzzy matching, so if you type `abyslwp`, it will understand
    that you mean abyssal whip. Same happens if you manage to misspell it slightly, so `abyslswhip` should also return abyssal
    whip. The prices are all retrieved from OSBuddy exchange.
